Heeeey, I'm Jasiel and I love the music from [King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpUKO-WKaqo), I also create [shaders](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Darkensses) for fun which led me to get into computer graphics with [ThreeJS](https://x.com/Darkensses/status/1887982603866698227). I train and play flag football 🚩🏈
